"""
Abstract Connector interface for ingesting threaded discussions.

Every data source — Reddit dumps, Hacker News dumps, GitHub Discussions exports,
custom forum scrapes — implements this interface. The pipeline downstream sees
only Conversation objects; it never knows which Connector produced them.

A Connector has three responsibilities:

  1. Read raw data from its source (parquet, JSON, archive, etc.)
  2. Normalize that data into the canonical schema
  3. Yield Conversations either by ID (`fetch_conversation`) or in bulk (`list_conversations`)

The Connector is the ONLY place in the toolkit that knows about source-specific
formats. Anything source-specific that doesn't fit the canonical schema goes
into `Utterance.metadata` or `Conversation.metadata`.

Design notes:

  * Sync, not async. The reference implementation reads local parquet via
    pandas; wrapping that in async buys nothing. Future HTTP-based connectors
    can add an `AsyncConnector` Protocol alongside without touching this one.

  * Per-connector `Config` subclasses (Pydantic). Configuration is type-validated
    at construction time. No kwargs soup, no global config.

  * Malformed conversations: skipped with a warning by default. Set
    `config.strict=True` to raise instead. Orphan comments, deleted roots, and
    broken parent references are common in real dumps; failing on the first
    bad row kills a bulk run.
